## How to Contribute

### Discuss

If you want to share an idea to further enhance
the project or discuss potential use cases, please feel free to create a discussion at the
[GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/discussions).
If you feel there is a bug or an issue, contribute to the discussions in
[existing issues](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen),
otherwise [create a new issue](#create-an-issue). 

### Create an Issue

If you have identified a bug or want to formulate a working item that you want to concentrate on, 
feel free to create a new issue at our project's corresponding
[GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/issues/new).

Before doing so, please consider searching for potentially suitable
[existing issues](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).

We also use [GitHub's default label set](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels)
extended by custom ones to classify issues and improve findability.

If an issue appears to cover changes that will have a (huge) impact on the code base and needs to 
first be discussed, or if you just have a question regarding the usage of the software, please 
create a [discussion](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/discussions) 
before raising an issue.

Please note that if an issue covers a topic or the response to a question that may be interesting 
for other developers or contributors, or for further discussions, it should be converted to a 
discussion and not be closed.

### Adhere to Coding Style Guide

We aim for a coherent and consistent code base, thus the coding style detailed in the 
[styleguide](styleguide.md) should be followed.

### Submit a Pull Request

In addition to the contribution guideline made available in the 
[Eclipse project handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#contributing),
we would appreciate if your pull request applies to the following points:

* Always apply the following copyright header to specific files in your work replacing the fields 
  enclosed by curly brackets "{}" with your own identifying information. (Don't include the curly 
  brackets!) Enclose the text in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format.

    ```text
    Copyright (c) {year} {owner}[ and others]

    This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the
    terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0 which is available at
    https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

    SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

    Contributors:
      {name} - {description}
    ```

* The git commit messages should comply to the following format:
    ```
    <component>: <description>
    ```

  Use the [imperative mood](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches)
  as in "Fix bug" or "Add feature" rather than "Fixed bug" or "Added feature" and
  [mention the GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
  e.g. `transfer process: improve logging, closes #3`.

  All committers, and all commits, are bound to
  the [Developer Certificate of Origin.](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/DCO.php)
  As such, all parties involved in a contribution must have valid ECAs. Additionally, commits can 
  include a ["Signed-off-by" entry](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contributing_via_Git).
* We prefer small changes and short living branches. Please do not combine independent things in one
  pull request.


* Excessive branching and merging can make git history confusing. With that in mind please

    * [squash your commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#_squashing)
      down to a few commits, or one commit, before submitting a pull request and
    * [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) your pull request changes on 
      top of the current master. Pull requests shouldn't include merge commits.

* Add meaningful tests to verify your submission acts as expected.

* Where code is not self-explanatory, add documentation providing extra clarification.

* Add relevant changes (e.g., no typo fixes, updated readme files, fixes of stuck test) to the 
  [changelog](CHANGELOG.md). If these refer to a new feature, add this to the `Overview` section 
  and add your changes to the `Detailed Changes` section according to the rules documented on 
  <http://keepachangelog.com>. Include more information via linking to existing pull requests,
  issues, or discussions.

* If a new module has been added or a significant part of the code has been changed and you should 
  or want to be seen as the contact person for any further changes, please add appropriate 
  information to the [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) 
  file. You can find instructions on how to do this at <https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/>.
  Please note that this file does not represent all contributions to the code. What persons and organizations
  actually contributed to each file can be seen on GitHub and is documented in the license headers.

* PR descriptions should use the current [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

* Submit a draft pull request at early-stage and add people previously working on the same code as 
  reviewer. Make sure automatically checks pass before marking it as "ready for review":

    * _Intellectual Property Validation_ verifying the [Eclipse CLA](#eclipse-contributor-agreement) 
      has been signed as well as commits have been signed-off and
    * _Continuous Integration_ performing various test conventions.

### Report on Flaky Tests

If you discover a randomly failing ("flaky") test, please take the time to check whether an issue for that already
exists and if not, create an issue yourself, providing meaningful description and a link to the failing run. Please also
label it with `Bug` and `FlakyTest`. Then assign it to whoever was the original author of the relevant piece of code or
whoever worked on it last. If assigning the issue is not possible due to missing rights, please just comment and
@mention the author/last editor.

Please do not just restart the run, as this would overwrite the results. If you need to, a better way of doing this is
to push an empty commit. This will trigger another run.

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger CI" && git push
```

If an issue labeled with `Bug` and `FlakyTest` is assigned to you, please prioritize addressing this issue as other people will be affected.
We are taking the quality of our code very serious and reporting on flaky tests is an important step toward improvement
in that area.

## Project and Milestone Planning

We use milestones to set a common focus for a period of 6 to 8 weeks. 
The group of committers chooses issues based on customer needs and contributions we expect.

### Projects

The [GitHub Projects page](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/projects)
provides a general overview of the project's working items. Every new issue must not but can be 
assigned to the ["Dataspace Connector" project](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/projects/1),
or any other project that is provided.

There, an issue passes four stages: `Backlog`, `In progress`, `Review in progress`, and `Done`,
independent of their association to a specific milestone.

Issues that are not already assigned to a project can be filtered in the 
[GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/issues)
using `is:issue is:open no:project`.

### Milestones

Milestones are organized at the 
[GitHub Milestones page](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/milestones).
They are numbered in ascending order.

The due date of a milestone does not imply any guarantee that all linked issued will be resolved by 
then. The milestone `Milestone Scoping` is a permanent milestone without a due date. Issues that 
should be considered for future milestones but already need to be targeted for the current one will 
be assigned here. This way, contributors, users, and adopters can track the progress.

When closing the current milestone, issues assigned to `Milestone Scoping` can stay there, be moved 
to the next milestone, or get removed from all milestones. In general, issues that were not resolved 
within a milestone phase will be reviewed to evaluate their relevance and priority, before being
assigned to the next milestone.

#### Issues

Every issue that should be addressed during a milestone phase is assigned to it by using the 
`Milestone` feature for linking both items. This way, the issues can easily be filtered by 
milestones.

#### Pull Requests

Pull requests are not assigned to milestones, as their linking to issues are sufficient to track 
the relations and progresses.
