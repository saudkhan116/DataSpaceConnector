/**
 * Interface for custom implementations of {@link ExecutorInstrumentation}.
 * <p>
 * A distinct interface is needed for dependency injection to resolve the optional
 * {@link ExecutorInstrumentationImplementation} vs. the mandatory {@link ExecutorInstrumentation}
 * that is provided by core services, providing a default implementation if none is provided.
 * <p>
 * The Micrometer extension provides a {@link ExecutorInstrumentationImplementation}.
 * The core extension consumes an (optional) {@link ExecutorInstrumentationImplementation}
 * and registers a {@link ExecutorInstrumentation}
 * (with either the {@link ExecutorInstrumentationImplementation} instance or a default implementation).
 * Downstream modules consume a (mandatory) {@link ExecutorInstrumentation}.
 * <p>
 * Because of the way dependencies are resolved (with a graph) it's not possible for
 * the core extension to consume and register the same service.
